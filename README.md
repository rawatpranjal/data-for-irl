# Sequential Choices Datasets

A curated list of open datasets capturing agent movements and choices through geographical spaces or economic decisions, suitable for inverse reinforcement learning projects.

## Discrete Economic Choices

- **[Career Decisions of Young Men](https://github.com/lindamaok899/student-project-lindamaok899)**: Utilized by Keane and Wolpin (1997), this dataset tracks the educational and occupational choices of young men over time, providing insights into career path decisions.

- **[Bus Engine Replacement Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erichschulman/bus1234.csv)**: Analyzed in John Rust's seminal 1987 paper, this dataset details the maintenance decisions of a bus company regarding engine replacements.

## Geographical Trajectories

- **[GeoLife GPS Trajectory Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/)**: Collected by Microsoft Research Asia, this dataset includes 17,621 trajectories from 182 users over three years, detailing movements such as walking, cycling, and driving.

- **[GPS Trajectories with Transportation Mode Labels](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/gps-trajectories-with-transportation-mode-labels/)**: This dataset provides GPS trajectories labeled with transportation modes like walking, biking, and driving, useful for analyzing movement patterns.

- **[Mobile Century Experiment GPS Trajectory Data](https://github.com/ucbtrans/mcdata)**: Contains 8 hours of GPS data from 100 vehicles on a 10-mile stretch of I-880 in California, collected during the Mobile Century experiment by UC Berkeley.

- **[SynMob: Synthetic GPS Trajectory Dataset](https://github.com/mitll/synmob)**: Offers high-fidelity synthetic GPS trajectories for urban mobility analysis, providing diverse trajectory patterns that cover entire urban areas.

## Virtual Movements

- **[AI4Animation](https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation)**: A collection of motion datasets and tools for character animation, useful for analyzing avatar movements in virtual environments.

## Gaming Datasets

- **[Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U Datasets](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.17680)**: These datasets provide trajectory sequences with xy-coordinates (in yards) for players in basketball, football, and soccer games, respectively. Each dataset includes 91 games, offering unnormalized coordinates and insights into player movements.

- **[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) Agent Data](https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2021/reports/102988723.pdf)**: This dataset captures the gameplay data of an AI agent playing CS:GO, including enemy detection via a YOLOv5 network and movement control through a deep neural network, enabling research on real-time decision-making in FPS games.

- **[StarCraftImage Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04290)**: Compiled from StarCraft II replays, this dataset contains 3.6 million images summarizing gameplay, with formats like RGB and grayscale. It supports analysis of complex multi-agent behaviors in strategy games.

- **[Awesome Game Datasets](https://github.com/leomaurodesenv/game-datasets)**: A curated list of datasets related to game development, including player and avatar movement data.
